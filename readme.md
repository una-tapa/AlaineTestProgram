# Alaine's standalone program

## Overview
Hi!  These are some programs I use when testing things standalone. 
- testProtocols.java will find out what protocols are supported on a given host and port.  This is a good one to play around with to do protocol and cipher related things on a connection.
- ClientSSL.java and ServerJSSE.java are a client/server program.  I think it originally came from the java team.  Good us when you want to do some client server stuff on a smaller scale.
-	newCert.java will create a self-signed certificate and use it to sign a certificate.  This program is good to use if your trying to test things out with certificate creation APIs,  newSsCert() and newCert().
